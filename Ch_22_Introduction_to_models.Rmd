A model provides a low-dimensional summary of a dataset.
It ignores noise and extracts the signal of the phenomena of interest.
We will only go into supervised models, and that too only
mechanistically. The theory is not going to be part of this book.

We also don't provide any tools for accessing the models.

## 22.1 Hypothesis generation vs. hypothesis confirmation

We will use models as a tool for exploration.

Usually models are used for inference. If you do this without
doing exploration, you will remain blind to the quality problems
within your data.
