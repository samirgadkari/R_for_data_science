```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringi)

read_path = Sys.getenv('DATASETS')
write_path = paste(read_path, 'output', sep = '/')
working_dir = Sys.getenv('R_WORKING_DIR')

full_read_path <- function(filename) {
  paste(read_path, filename, sep = '/')
}

full_write_path <- function(filename) {
  paste(write_path, filename, sep = '/')
}

full_wd_path <- function(filename) {
  paste(working_dir, filename, sep = '/')
}
```

This chapter is mostly about regular expressions. We use the stringr
package that is a part of the tidyverse for string manipulation.
Rules for declaring strings:

  * Use double quotes "" to declare strings
  * If you have to use " in a string, use '' to declare that string
  * If you have to use both single and double quotes in a string,
    use double quotes to declare the string, and then use the
    \ character to escape the double quote within the string
    
I've been using single quotes for strings, but will not change to use
double quotes from here on.
```{r}
x <- c("\'", "\\")
x             # printing out the string will show escape characters in it.
writeLines(x) # writeLines shows you how the string will look like
```
Special characters: "\n", "\t", "\\", "\"", "\'" 
Use ?"'" to find help in the console for quotes and backslash characters.

Unicode specified characters:
```{r}
x <- "\u00b5"
x
```

### 14.2.1 String length
```{r}
str_length(c("a", "R for data science", NA))
```

### 14.2.2 Combining strings
```{r}
str_c("x", "y")
str_c("x", "y", "z")
str_c("x", "y", sep = ", ")
```
```{r}
x <- c("abc", NA)
str_c("|-", x, "-|")
str_c("|-", str_replace_na(x), "-|")
```
As seen above str_c is vectorised. It automatically recycles shorter
vectors to the same length as the longest:
```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
str_c("prefix-", x, "-suffix")
```

str_c drops object of 0 lengths:
```{r}
name <- "Hadley"
time_of_day <- "morning"
birthday <- FALSE

str_c("Good ", time_of_day, " ", name,
      if (birthday) " and Happy Birthday.", # this becomes a 0-length
                                            # strings and is dropped.
      ".")
```

How sep and collapse are used by str_c if collapse is not NULL:
1. Each vector is resized to the largest vector length using usual
   recycling rules.
2. The separator is placed between each vector.
3. The collapse value is placed at the end of each row
4. The string is collapsed row-by-row into a single value.
   Each row, after it is printed, receives a space as a separator.
If collapse is not specified, each row becomes a string in a vector.
If collapse is specified, the output is a single character string.
```{r}
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), sep = ', ', collapse = "v ")
# x  , a  v
# y  , b  v
# z  , c

str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), collapse = "v ")
# x  a  v
# y  b  v
# z  c

str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), sep = ", ")
# x  , a
# y  , b
# z  , c

length(str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), sep = ", "))
```

### 14.2.3 Subsetting strings

You can extract parts of a string using str_sub:
```{r}
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x, 1, 3)
str_sub(x, -3, -1)  # negative numbers count from backwards

str_sub("a", 1, 5)  # str_sub won't fail if the string is small.
                    # It will just return as much as possible.

# You can use the assignment form of str_sub to modify strings.
# You can use:
#   str_sub
#   str_to_upper
#   str_to_lower
#   str_to_title
str_sub(x, 1, 1) <- str_to_lower(str_sub(x, 1, 1))
x
```

### 14.2.4 Locales

Changing case is complicated because each language has a different way
of changing case.
```{r}
# Turkish has two i's: with and without a dot, and it
# has a different rule for capitalising them:
str_to_upper(c("i", "ı"))
str_to_upper(c("i", "ı"), 
             locale = "tr") # locale specified by ISO639 language code.
                            # Without a locale, the OS locale is used.
                            # Specify locale to be consistent across
                            # computers
```

Locale also affects sorting:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "eggplant", "banana")
str_sort(x, locale = "en") # English
str_sort(x, locale = "haw") # Hawaiian
```

### 14.2.5 Exercises

1. In code that doesn’t use stringr, you’ll often see paste() and paste0(). What’s the difference between the two functions? What stringr function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of NA?

paste converts it's arguments into characters and concatenates them 
into a single output using sep as separator.
paste is equivalent to str_c with collapse set to the sep value.

paste0 does the same, except it's separator is "".
paste0 is equivalent to str_c with collapse set to ""

2. In your own words, describe the difference between the sep and collapse arguments to str_c().

How sep and collapse are used by str_c if collapse is not NULL:

  * Each vector is resized to the largest vector length using usual
    recycling rules.
  * The separator is placed between each vector.
  * The collapse value is placed at the end of each row
  * The string is collapsed row-by-row into a single value.
    Each row, after it is printed, receives a space as a separator.

If collapse is NULL, each row becomes a string in a vector.
If collapse is not NULL, the output is a single character string.
```{r}
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), sep = ', ', collapse = "v ")
# x  , a  v
# y  , b  v
# z  , c

str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), collapse = "v ")
# x  a  v
# y  b  v
# z  c

str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), sep = ", ")
# x  , a
# y  , b
# z  , c

length(str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), sep = ", "))
``` 
From this we can say that sep separates column values, and 
collapse separates row values. collapse also specifies that we want
a single string as output.

3. Use str_length() and str_sub() to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?

I'm going to pick the length %/% 2 as the middle character for an
even-length string, and length %/% 2 + 1 as the middle character for
an odd-length string:
```{r}
x <- c("that", "toothpick")
len = str_length(x)
mid <- ifelse(len %% 2 == 0, len %/% 2, len %/% 2 + 1)
str_sub(x, mid, mid)
```

4. What does str_wrap() do? When might you want to use it?

str_wrap allows you to indent/exdent a list of paragraphs given as
strings in a vector. You can use it to write a document without 
indentation and update it to whichever form you choose:

  * first line indented by given number of characters in all paragraphs
  * all but first line indented by given number of chars in all paras

```{r}
thanks_path <- file.path(R.home("doc"), "THANKS")
thanks <- str_c(readLines(thanks_path), collapse = "\n")
thanks <- word(thanks, 1, 3, fixed("\n\n"))
cat(str_wrap(thanks, 
             width = 40, # target line width in characters
             # indent = 4, # indent the starting paragraph line by chars
             exdent = 4),# indent all but first line by chars
    "\n")
```

5. What does str_trim() do? What’s the opposite of str_trim()?

str_trim: removes whitespace from start and end of string.
          str_trim(string, side = "both" | "left" | "right")
str_squish: remove repeated whitespace within string
            str_squish(string)
str_pad: add whitespace to beginning/end/both sides of string
         str_pad(string, width, side = "both" | "left" | "right")
         
6. Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector c("a", "b", "c") into the string a, b, and c. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2.

```{r}
combine <- function(v) {
  case_when(
    (length(v) == 0) ~ "",
    (length(v) == 1) ~ v[1],
    (length(v) == 2) ~ str_c(v, collapse = " and "),
    TRUE ~ {
      part <- str_c(v[1 : length(v) - 1], collapse = ", ")
      str_c(c(part, v[length(v)]), collapse = ", and ")
    }
  )
}

combine(c())
combine(c("1"))
combine(c("1", "2"))
combine(c("a", "b", "c"))
```

## 14.3 Matching patterns with regular expressions

str_view and str_view_all take a character vector and a regular expression
and show you how they match.
str_view shows the first match, str_view_all shows all matches.

### 14.3.1 Basic matches

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")  # match the letters exactly
str_view(x, ".a.") # . matches any character
```
How do you match the character "."? You escape it using "\.". But since
we have \ inside the string, to escape it you have to append a \ before
it, so our regex becomes "\\.". writeLines below shows that this is
actually "\."
```{r}
dot <- "\\."
writeLines(dot)
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")
```

To match "\", we need to use "\\\\" as the regex.
```{r}
x <- "a\\b"
writeLines(x)
str_view(x, "\\\\")
```
Here, regex will be written \. and the regex string will be written "\\."

#### 14.3.1.1 Exercises

1. Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\".

To match, you need "\\\\:". Neither of the expressions shown matches \:
```{r}
x <- "\\:"
str_view(x, "\\\\:")
```

2. How would you match the sequence "'\?

```{r}
x <- "\"'\\"
writeLines(x)
str_view(x, "\"\'\\\\")
```

3. What patterns will the regular expression \..\..\.. match? How would you represent it as a string?

It will match a . followed by any character followed by another .
followed by any character followed by another . and any character.
It can be represented as: "\\..\\..\\.."
```{r}
x <- ".a.b.c"
str_view(x, "\\..\\..\\..")
```

### 14.3.2 Anchors


  * ^ to match the start of the string.
  * $ to match the end of the string.
  * To force a regex to match the complete string, use both ^ and $
  * Mnemonic to remember these: If you start with power (^),
    you will end up with money ($).

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")
str_view(x, "a$")
```
```{r}
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
str_view(x, "apple")
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```
You can also match the boundary between words with \b. This is not
usually used, but you can use it when finding functions in RStudio help.
ex. \bsum\b will match sum and not summarise.

#### 14.3.2.1 Exercises

1. How would you match the literal string "$^$"?
```{r}
x <- "$^$"
str_view(x, "\\$\\^\\$")
```
2. Given the corpus of common words in stringr::words, create regular expressions that find all words that:

  1. Start with “y”.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "^y", match = TRUE)
```
  
  2. End with “x”
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "x$", match = TRUE)
```
  
  3. Are exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using str_length()!)
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "^...$", match = TRUE)
```
  
  4. Have seven letters or more.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "........*", match = TRUE)
str_view(stringr::words, ".{7,}", match = TRUE)
```
### 14.3.3 Character classes and alternatives

  * \d: matches any digit.
  * \s: matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
  * [abc]: matches a, b, or c.
  * [^abc]: matches anything except a, b, or c.

```{r}
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), "a[.]c")
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), ".[*]c")
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), "a[ ]")
```
Inside a character class, ] \ ^ - have special meaning, and
have to be preceded by a \

Alternation:
```{r}
str_view(c("grey", "gray"), "gr(e|a)y")
```
#### 14.3.3.1 Exercises


1. Create regular expressions to find all words that:

  1. Start with a vowel.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "^[aeiou]", match = TRUE)
```
  
  2. That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "^[^aeiou]*$", match = TRUE)
```
  
  3. End with ed, but not with eed.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "[^e]ed$", match = TRUE)
```
  
  4. End with ing or ise.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "(ing|ise)$", match = TRUE)
```

### 14.3.4 Repetition

  * ?: 0 or 1
  * +: 1 or more
  * *: 0 or more
  * {n}: exactly n
  * {n,}: n or more
  * {,m}: at most m
  * {n,m}: between n and m

These matches are all greedy. Put ? after them to make them lazy.

```{r}
x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "CC+")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "C[LX]+")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "C{2}")
str_view(x, "C{2,}")
str_view(x, "C{2,3}")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "C{2,3}?")
str_view(x, "C[LX]+?")
```
#### 14.3.4.1 Exercises

1. Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form.

? is the same as {0, 1}
```{r}
str_view("thiiis", "tho?")
str_view("thiiis", "tho{0,1}")
```
+ is the same as {1,} which means 1 or more
```{r}
str_view("thiiis", "thi+")
str_view("thiiis", "thi{1,}")
```
* is the same as {0,} which means 0 or more
```{r}
str_view("thiiis", "thi*")
str_view("thiiis", "thi{0,}")
```

2. Describe in words what these regular expressions match: (read carefully to see if I’m using a regular expression or a string that defines a regular expression.)

    1. ^.*$
  
  Matches any characters with any length until the newline
  
    2. "\\{.+\\}"
  
  Matches a { followed by any characters except newline and then a }
  
    3. \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}
  
  Matches 4 digits, then a -, then 2 digits, then a -, then 2 digits
  
    4. "\\\\{4}"

  Matches 4 \ characters
  
3. Create regular expressions to find all words that:

  1. Start with three consonants.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "^[^aeiou]{3}", match = TRUE)
```
  
  2. Have three or more vowels in a row.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "[aeiou]{3,}", match = TRUE)
```
  
  3. Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "([aeiou][^aeiou]){2,}", match = TRUE)
```

4. Solve the beginner regexp crosswords at [https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/beginner](https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/beginner)

### 14.3.5 Grouping and backreferences

Parentheses create numbered capturing groups. You can refer to them using
their number \1, \2 etc.
```{r}
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```
#### 14.3.5.1 Exercises

1. 

Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:

  * (.)\1\1
  
  Matches a character that occurs 3 times in a row
  
  * "(.)(.)\\2\\1"
  
  Matches a character, then another character that occurs twice,
  then the same first character
  
  * (..)\1
  
  Matches two characters occurring twice in sequence
  
  * "(.).\\1.\\1"
  
  Matches a character, then another character, then the first character,
  then another character, then the first character again, in sequence.
  
  * "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"

  Matches 3 or more characters, followed by any characters or no
  characters, followed by the reverse sequence of the first 3
  matching characters
  
2. 

Construct regular expressions to match words that:

  1. Start and end with the same character.
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "^(.).*\\1$", match = TRUE)
```
  
  2. Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. “church” contains “ch” repeated twice.)
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "(.)(.).*\\1\\2", match = TRUE)
```

  3. Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. “eleven” contains three “e”s.)
```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "(.).*\\1.*\\1", match = TRUE)
```

## 14.4 Tools

Lets apply regex matching to solve problems. You will learn many stringr
functions that allow you to:

  * Determine which strings match a pattern.
  * Find the positions of matches.
  * Extract the content of matches.
  * Replace matches with new values.
  * Split a string based on a match.

Don’t forget that you’re in a programming language and you have 
other tools at your disposal. Instead of creating one 
complex regular expression, it’s often easier to write a series 
of simpler regexps.

### 14.4.1 Detect matches

  * str_detect: checks if a string matches a pattern.
    str_detect returns a logical vector, so you can:
    
    + use sum() over it to get the number of matches
    + use mean() over it to get the proportion of matches
  * str_count: tells you how many matches there are in a string.
    The matches never overlap. i.e. In "abababa", "aba" occurs twice,
    not 3 times.

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_detect(x, "e")
```
How many words start with "^t"? What is their proportion to the full
list of words?
```{r}
sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))
mean(str_detect(words, "^t"))
```

When you have complex logical conditions (e.g. match a or b but not c unless d) it’s often easier to combine multiple str_detect() calls with logical operators, rather than trying to create a single regular expression:
```{r}
# Find words containing at least one vowel and negate.
# This is the same as words not containing any vowel.
no_vowels_1 <- !str_detect(words, "[aeiou]")

# Find words containing only consonants
no_vowels_2 <- str_detect(words, "^[^aeiou]+$")

# Compare the two lists of words - they should be the same.
identical(no_vowels_1, no_vowels_2)
```

To get the list of words matching the pattern:
```{r}
words[str_detect(words, "x$")]
str_subset(words, "x$")
```

Usually, your strings are in a column of a dataframe, so you can use
filter to filter out rows with the regex matching your text
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  word = words,
  i = seq_along(word) # Creates an integer sequence along the given column
)

df %>%
  filter(str_detect(word, "x$"))
```

str_count tells you how many matches there are in a string:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_count(x, "a")

# On average, how many vowels per word?
mean(str_count(x, "[aeiou]"))
```

Using str_count with mutate:
```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    consonants = str_count(word, "[^aeiou]")
  )
```

The matches never overlap. i.e. In "abababa", "aba" occurs twice,
not 3 times:
```{r}
str_count("abababa", "aba")
str_view_all("abababa", "aba")
```
Many stringr functions come in pairs. One matches the pattern once and
returns. The paired function with "_all" at the end matches all the
pattern until the end of the string.

#### 14.4.1.1 Exercises

1. For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls.

  1. Find all words that start or end with x.
```{r}
str_view_all(words, "(^x)|(x$)", match = TRUE)
```
  
  2. Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
```{r}
str_view_all(words, "^[aeiou].*[^aeiou]$", match = TRUE)
```
  
  3. Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?
```{r}
words_with_a <- words[str_detect(words, "a")]
words_with_ae <- words_with_a[str_detect(words_with_a, "e")]
words_with_aei <- words_with_ae[str_detect(words_with_ae, "i")]
words_with_aeio <- words_with_aei[str_detect(words_with_aei, "o")]
(words_with_aeiou <- words_with_aeio[str_detect(words_with_aeio, "u")])
```
There are no words with all the different vowels.

4. What word has the highest number of vowels? What word has the highest proportion of vowels? (Hint: what is the denominator?)
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  word = words,
  i = seq_along(word)
)

df %>%
  mutate(num_vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]")) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_vowels))

df %>%
  mutate(prop_vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]")/str_length(word)) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop_vowels))
```

This shows the words with the highest number of vowels (5).
The highest proportion of vowels are words a and i. I is not shown
because words does not contain it:
```{r}
'i' %in% words
```

### 14.4.2 Exact matches

  * str_extract: to extract the actual text of a first match
  * str_extract_all: to extract the actual text of all matches

We will use Harvard sentences for the extraction
```{r}
length(sentences)
head(sentences)
```

```{r}
colors <- c("red", "green", "blue", "purple", "yellow", "orange")
(color_match <- str_c(colors, collapse = "|"))
has_color <- str_subset(sentences, color_match)
matches <- str_extract(has_color, color_match)
head(matches)
```

```{r}
# You can also use subsetting by []:
identical(sentences[str_detect(sentences, color_match)],
          str_subset(sentences, color_match))
```

str_extract only extracts the first match.
Use str_extract_all to extract all matches.
```{r}
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, color_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more, color_match)
str_extract(more, color_match) # returns only first match
str_extract_all(more, color_match) # returns a list of lists. Each inner
                                   # list shows colors in a sentence.
```

With simplify = TRUE, str_extract_all will return a matrix, 
one row for a sentence, one column for a match. It will expand the matrix
to the maximum number of matches in a sentence:
```{r}
str_extract_all(more, color_match, simplify = TRUE)

x <- c("a", "a b", "a b c")
str_extract_all(x, "[a-z]", simplify = TRUE)
str_extract(x, "[a-z]")
```
#### 14.4.2.1 Exercises

1. In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem.
```{r}
color_match_exact <- str_c("\\b", color_match, "\\b", collapse = "")
str_view_all(more, color_match_exact)
```
2. From the Harvard sentences data, extract:

  1. The first word from each sentence.
```{r}
head(str_extract(sentences, "^[\\w\\']+\\b"))
```
  
  2. All words ending in ing.
```{r}
ending_in_ing <- str_extract_all(sentences, 
                                 "\\b\\w+?ing\\b", simplify = TRUE)
ending_in_ing[str_length(ending_in_ing) > 0]
```

  3. All plurals.
```{r}
plural_words <- flatten(str_extract_all(sentences, "\\b\\w+?s\\b"))
plural_words[str_length(plural_words) > 1]

# or we can do this as well - it's nicer
plural_words <- sentences %>%
  str_extract_all("\\b\\w+?s\\b")
# but we cannot remove the no-match sentences:
plural_words[str_length(plural_words) > 1]
```
There are many words here like "is", "his", was" which are not plural,
but contain "s" at the end. Not sure how to remove these.

### Grouped matches

  * str_extract gives the complete match
  * str_match gives the full match in the first output,
    and individual group matches in the following outputs.
    It does that only for the first match.
  * str_match_all is the same as str_match, but
    it will give matches throughout the string
  * with a tibble, you should probably use extract.
    It gives the same result as str_match, but you need to
    provide each group's column name.
  
Parentheses allow you to extract matching groups.
Let's look nouns, which we will say are any word that comes after 
"a" or "the".
```{r}
noun <- "(a|the) ([^ ]+)"
has_noun <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(noun) %>%
  head(10)
has_noun %>%
  str_extract(noun)
```

```{r}
has_noun %>%
  str_match(noun)
```
str_match gives the full match in the first output,
and individual group matches in the following outputs.

```{r}
tibble(sentence = sentences) %>%
  tidyr::extract(
    sentence, c("article", "noun"), "(a|the) ([^ ]+)",
    remove = FALSE  # remove input column or not
  )
```

#### 14.4.3.1 Exercises

1. Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word.

```{r}
numbers <- str_c(c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven",
                   "eight", "nine", "ten"),
                 collapse = "|")
(numbers <- str_c("\\b(", numbers, ")", " ([^ ]+)", collapse = ""))
tibble(sentence = sentences) %>%
  extract(
    sentence, c("number", "word_after"), numbers,
    remove = FALSE
  )
```

2. Find all contractions. Separate out the pieces before and after the apostrophe.

```{r}
tibble(sentence = sentences) %>%
  extract(
    sentence, c("before", "after"), "\\b([^ ]+)'([^ ]+\\b)",
    remove = FALSE
  )
```

### 14.4.4 Replacing matches

  * str_replace: replace first match with new string
  * str_replace_all: replace all matches with new string.
    With str_replace_all, you can perform multiple replacements by
    supplying a named vector.
  
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```

With str_replace_all, you can perform multiple replacements by
supplying a named vector.
```{r}
x <- c("1 house", "2 cars", "3 people")
str_replace_all(x, c("1" = "one", "2" = "two", "3" = "three"))
```

You can replace using backreferences:
```{r}
sentences %>%
  str_replace("([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+)",
              "\\1 \\3 \\2") %>%
  head(5)
```

#### 14.4.4.1 Exercises

1. Replace all forward slashes in a string with backslashes.
```{r}
writeLines(str_replace_all("this/is/a/test", "/", "\\\\"))
```
2. Implement a simple version of str_to_lower() using replace_all().

```{r}
replace_f <- function(x) {
  case_when(
    # You should do this for the entire alphabet,
    # but you get the picture.
    x == "T" ~ "t",
    x == "I" ~ "i",
    x == "A" ~ "a"
  )
}
str_replace_all("This Is A Test.", "[A-Z]", 
                replace_f)
```

3. Switch the first and last letters in words. Which of those strings are still words?
```{r}
switched <- str_replace(words, "^([^ ])(.*)([^ ])", "\\3\\2\\1")
words[switched == words]
```

### 14.4.5 Splitting

  * str_split: split a string into pieces.
    You can also specify simplify = TRUE to get the output as a matrix.
    You can ask for a specific number of columns using n = . 
    The string will only be split as many times as the requested columns.
  
```{r}
sentences %>%
  str_split(" ") %>%
  head(5)
```
When each component of a list can produce different-length lists,
you get a list of lists.
If you have a string (length-1 vector), str_split will still give you
just a list of lists. You can get the first element of that to get
your simple list. Or you can simplify = TRUE to get a matrix.
```{r}
"a|b|c|d" %>%
  str_split("\\|")
"a|b|c|d" %>%
  str_split("\\|") %>%
  .[[1]]
"a|b|c|d" %>%
  str_split("\\|", simplify = TRUE)
```
```{r}
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>%
  str_split(" ", simplify = TRUE)
```
You can ask for a specific number of columns using n = . The string will
only be split as many times as the requested columns
```{r}
fields <- c("Name: James: Hadley", "Country: New: Zealand", "Age: 3: 5")
fields %>% str_split(": ", n = 3, simplify = TRUE)
```

You can also split up by character, line, sentence, or word boundary.
```{r}
x <- "This is a line. This is another line."
str_view_all(x, boundary("word"))
str_split(x, boundary("character"))
str_split(x, boundary("sentence"))
```

```{r}
str_split(x, " ")[[1]]
str_split(x, boundary("word"))[[1]]
x %>%
  str_split(boundary("word")) %>%
  .[[1]]
```

#### 14.4.5.1 Exercises

1. Split up a string like "apples, pears, and bananas" into individual components.
```{r}
x <- "apples, pears, and bananas"
str_split(x, boundary("word"))
```

2. Why is it better to split up by boundary("word") than " "?

A word boundary includes , . etc. in addition to spaces.
This allows us to get only the words, instead of puncutation attached
to words.

3. What does splitting with an empty string ("") do? Experiment, and then read the documentation.
```{r}
x <- "apples, pears, and bananas"
str_split(x, "")
```
Splitting with an empty string "" splits string into characters.
An empty pattern "" is equivalent to boundary("character").

### 14.4.6 Find matches

  * str_locate: gives you the start/end position of first match.
    Useful when other functions don't help. Use str_locate to find the
    match, and str_sub to extract it.
  * str_locate_all: Finds start/end position of each match for the
    whole string.
    
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_locate(x, "a.")
str_locate_all(x, "a.")
```
## 14.5 Other types of patterns

A pattern that is a string is automatically wrapped in a regex call.
Inside that call, you can specify:
  
  * All regex parameters are FALSE by default
  * ignore_case (FALSE by default)
  * multiline (FALSE by default: ^ and $ match string beginning and end).
    If TRUE: $ and ^ match line beginning and end.
  * dotall (FALSE by default: makes . not match \n).
    If TRUE: makes . match \n so you can match across lines.
  * comments (FALSE by default: you cannot put in comments for the regex)
    If TRUE: you can put in comments inside regex quotes

```{r}
str_view(fruit, "nana", match = TRUE)
# this becomes
str_view(fruit, regex("nana"), match = TRUE)
```
You can specify flags to regex parser using regex function.
For example, by default ignore_case is TRUE
```{r}
bananas <- c("banana", "Banana", "BANANA")
str_view(bananas, regex("nana"))  # ignore_case = FALSE by default
str_view(bananas, regex("nana", ignore_case = TRUE))
```
By default, multiline = FALSE: matches ^ and $ to the full string.
With multiline = TRUE: matches ^ and $ to each line, not the full string.

```{r}
x <- "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
str_extract_all(x, "^Line")[[1]]
str_extract_all(x, regex("^Line", multiline = TRUE))[[1]]
```

comments (FALSE by default: you cannot put in comments for the regex).
If TRUE: you can put in comments inside regex quotes.
Comments are as usual in R, preceded by a #
```{r}
phone <- regex("
  \\(?     # optional opening parens
  (\\d{3}) # area code
  [) -]?   # optional closing parens, space, or dash
  (\\d{3}) # another three numbers
  [ -]?    # optional space or dash
  (\\d{3}) # three more numbers
  ", comments = TRUE)

str_match("514-791-8141", phone)
```

dotall (FALSE by default: makes . not match \n).
If TRUE: makes . match \n so you can match across lines.

Other functions you can use instead of regex:

  * fixed: matches exactly the given sequence of bytes.
    It ignores all regular expressions, and thus is around 4x faster.
    There are many ways of defining a letter in languages other than
    english.
    Those letters render identically, but are defined differently.
    So don't use fixed for anything other than english.
    Use coll for those languages.
  * coll: compare strings using different collation rules.
    This is useful for doing case insensitive matching.
    You can give coll a locale to select the correct rules.
    coll is just as slow as regex, since language rules are complicated.
    You cannot give locale to fixed and regex.
```{r}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  fixed = str_detect(sentences, fixed("the")),
  regex = str_detect(sentences, regex("the")),
  times = 20
)
```
    
To find out which locale you're using:
```{r}
stringi::stri_locale_info()
```

You can use boundary function with str_split, str_extract, and str_view.

### 14.5.1 Exercises

1. How would you find all strings containing \ with regex() vs. with fixed()?
```{r}
s <- c("\\this", "and", "\\that")
s[str_detect(s, "\\\\")]
s[str_detect(s, fixed("\\"))]
```
2. What are the five most common words in sentences?
```{r}
tibble(word = unlist(str_split(sentences, boundary("word")))) %>%
  mutate(word = str_to_lower(word)) %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  head(5)
```

## 14.6 Other uses of regular expressions

Base R useful functions that use regular expressions:

  * apropos: searches all global environment objects
  * dir: lists all files in a directory
  
```{r}
apropos("replace")
```
```{r}
head(dir(pattern = "\\.Rmd$"))
```

You can convert globs to regexs using glob2rx function.

## 14.7 stringi

stringr is built on top of stringi. stringr exposes the most useful
functions. stringi is comprehensive and contains 250 functions to
stringr's 49.

Take a look at stringi, if you're struggling to do something in stringr.
With stringi, the function prefix is not str_, it's stri_

### 14.7.1 Exercises

1. Find the stringi functions that:

  1. Count the number of words.
stri_stats_general: returns these statistics of a character vector:

  * Number of lines
  * Number of non-empty lines
  * Number of characters
  * Number of characters minus whitespace characters
  
stri_stats_latex: Used to get statistics of latex character vector.
You can also use it on any character vector.
It returns these statistics:

  * Number of word characters
  * Number of commands and word characters
  * Latex whitespaces including { and } in some contexts
  * Number of words
  * Number of commands
  * Number of environments
  

```{r}
s <- c('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.',
       'nibh augue, suscipit a, scelerisque sed, lacinia in, mi.',
       'Cras vel lorem. Etiam pellentesque aliquet tellus.',
       '')
stri_stats_general(s)
stri_stats_latex(s)
```
  
  2. Find duplicated strings.

stri_duplicated: Returns a logical vector telling us which strings in a
character vector are duplicated.

stri_duplicated_any: Tells us if there are any duplicated strings.
```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "a", NA, "a", NA)
stri_duplicated(x)
stri_duplicated_any(x)
```

  3. Generate random text.

stri_rand_strings: Generates random n strings of desired lengths.
You have to give a length for each string, so you need n lengths to
generate an n-string vector.

stri_rand_shuffle: Takes a character vector, and returns a vector
of the same length with characters shuffled in each string

stri_rand_lipsum: Takes the number of paragraphs to generate and
generates the Lorem Ipsum paragraphs.

```{r}
stri_rand_strings(4, c(1, 2, 4, 8))
```

```{r}
stri_rand_shuffle(c('okla', 'homa'))
```
```{r}
stri_rand_lipsum(2)
```

2. How do you control the language that stri_sort() uses for sorting?

You give it a locale = "" string.
```{r}
stri_sort(c("this", "is", "a", "test"), locale = "en")
```
