```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

Use functions to re-use parts of code from many different locations.

```{r}
df <- tibble::tibble(
  a = rnorm(100),
  b = rnorm(100),
  c = rnorm(100),
  d = rnorm(100)
)

# Instead of doing this for each variable:
# df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
#  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))

# This function rescales values in x to the 0-1 range.
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE, 
               finite = TRUE) # finite = TRUE tells function to ignore all
                              # non-finite elements.
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}

# Test it
rescale01(c(0, 5, 10))
rescale01(c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5))
rescale01(c(1:10, Inf))  # If the range function call above did not have
                         # finite = TRUE, Inf would be converted to NaN
```

You can learn more about unit testing [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html)

Now that the rescale01 function works, use it to rescale the tibble:
```{r}
df$a <- rescale01(df$a)
df$b <- rescale01(df$b)
df$c <- rescale01(df$c)
df$d <- rescale01(df$d)
```

### 19.2.1 Exercises

1. Why is TRUE not a parameter to rescale01()? What would happen if x contained a single missing value, and na.rm was FALSE?

TRUE is a value that is fixed. It is a constant, not a variable.
Since it does not change, there is no reason to pass it in as a variable.
Let's see what happens if x contained a single missing value, and
na.rm = FALSE
```{r}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = FALSE, # If we set na.rm = FALSE, and x contained
               finite = TRUE)    # an NA value, range ignores it in
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1]) # it's calculation, and rescale01 
}                                # returns the same NA value back for that
                                 # element.
rescale01(c(1, 2, NA))
```

2. In the second variant of rescale01(), infinite values are left unchanged. Rewrite rescale01() so that -Inf is mapped to 0, and Inf is mapped to 1.

```{r}
rescale01_mapped <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE, 
               finite = TRUE) # finite = TRUE tells function to ignore all
                              # non-finite elements.
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}

rescale01 <- function(x) {
  dplyr::case_when(
    x == -Inf ~ 0,
    x == Inf  ~ 1,
    TRUE      ~ rescale01_mapped(x)
  )
}

rescale01(c(0, 5, 10))
rescale01(c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5))
rescale01(c(1:10, -Inf, Inf))
```

3. Practice turning the following code snippets into functions. Think about what each function does. What would you call it? How many arguments does it need? Can you rewrite it to be more expressive or less duplicative?
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA)
mean(is.na(x))
mean_no_na <- function(x) {
  mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
mean_no_na(x)

x / sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
prop <- function(x) {
  x / sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
prop(x)

# The computed value here is the coefficient of variation.
# It tells you how much variation there is in the data.
sd(x, na.rm = TRUE) / mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
coeff_of_variation <- function(x) {
  sd(x, na.rm = TRUE) / mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
x
coeff_of_variation(x)
```

4. Write your own functions to compute the variance and skewness of a numeric vector. Variance is defined as:

![](images/variance.png)

Skewness is defined as:

![](images/skew.png)
```{r}
variance <- function(x) {
  # since our calculation requires at least one element,
  # return NA if x is empty
  len <- length(x)
  dplyr::case_when(
    len <= 1 ~ Inf,
    TRUE     ~ sum((x - mean_no_na(x))^2, na.rm = TRUE) / 
                (len - 1)
  )
}

variance(c(1, 2, 31))

skew <- function(x) {
  # Since our calculation requires at least 2 elements,
  # return NA if x has less than 2
  len <- length(x)
  dplyr::case_when(
    len <= 2 ~ Inf,
    TRUE     ~ sum((x - mean_no_na(x))^3, na.rm = TRUE) /
                ((len - 2) * ((variance(x))^1.5))
  )
}

skew(c(1, 2, 31))
```

5. Write both_na(), a function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns the number of positions that have an NA in both vectors.

```{r}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
  df <- tibble::tibble(x = x, y = y)
  df %>%
    filter(is.na(x), is.na(y)) %>%
    nrow()
}

both_na(c(1, NA, 2), c(2, NA, 3))
both_na(c(1, NA, NA), c(2, NA, 3))
both_na(c(1, NA, NA), c(2, NA, NA))
```

6. What do the following functions do? Why are they useful even though they are so short?

is_directory <- function(x) file.info(x)$isdir
This function returns TRUE if the file given is a directory, 
else it returns FALSE.

is_readable <- function(x) file.access(x, 4) == 0
This function checks the access rights to the file to see if the
user has read access.

They're useful because without them, the code will look cluttered.
Also, the name shows exactly what they're doing - this makes the
code very readable.

7. Read the complete lyrics to “Little Bunny Foo Foo”. There’s a lot of duplication in this song. Extend the initial piping example to recreate the complete song, and use functions to reduce the duplication.

I'm not going to do this. Sorry.

## 19.3 Functions are for humans and computers

  * Generally, function names should be verbs, arguments should be nouns.
    Sometimes, functions like mean, sd, etc. are nouns, but are preferred
    since it's better to say mean compared to compute_mean.
  * Select either snake_case or camelCase for your variable/function names
    Always keep using the same case throughout your code.
    This makes it easier to read.
  * Use a prefix if you have a family of functions. This way, when you
    type in that prefix, RStudio will tell you the possible completions.
  * Explain the "why" of your code with comments.
    The "how" and "what" should be self-explanatory by reading the code.
    
### 19.3.1 Exercises

1. Read the source code for each of the following three functions, puzzle out what they do, and then brainstorm better names.
```{r}
# Returns true if the prefix is actually the string prefix
f1 <- function(string, prefix) {
  substr(string, 1, nchar(prefix)) == prefix
}
f1("Christmas carol", "Christmas")

# Removes the rightmost value in the vector before returning it
f2 <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) <= 1) return(NULL)
  x[-length(x)]  # A negative index implies remove that value and
                 # return the vector.
}
f2(c("this", "is", "a", "test"))

# Repeats the x vector until it equals the length of y
f3 <- function(x, y) {
  rep(y, length.out = length(x))
}
f3(c("what", "is", "this"), c("something", "nothing"))
```

3. Compare and contrast rnorm() and MASS::mvrnorm(). How could you make them more consistent?

rnorm returns a vector with number of samples specified by n. It uses
the given mean/sd or 0 mean 1 sd.

MASS:mvrnorm returns a vector with the number of samples specified by n.
But, it uses a number of random variables to generate it's samples.
Each variable's mean is given with the covariance matrix. This makes it
a multivariate normal distribution.

MASS:mvrnorm with one mean and 1 variance == rnorm.
So you could just use MASS::mvrnorm

4. Make a case for why norm_r(), norm_d() etc would be better than rnorm(), dnorm(). Make a case for the opposite.

norm_r and norm_d would be better than rnorm and dnorm because when you
start typing norm, RStudio will give you a list of functions that have
norm as the prefix. This makes it easier to select the right one.

rnorm and dnorm is better because rnorm stands for random normal
distribution, and dnorm for density normal distribution, which are
commonly used. Also, rnorm and dnorm are easier to remember.
norm_r and norm_d seem kludgey.

## 19.4 Conditional execution

  * To get help of if, you have to surround it with backticks: ?`if`
  
```{r}
has_name <- function(x) {
  nms <- names(x) # This will give c('a', 'b') for x <- c(a = x, b = y)
  if (is.null(nms)) { # This is vectorized. It looks at each nms value.
    # rep(FALSE, length(x)) # I think this is wrong. Value returned
                            # should be only for the current index.
    FALSE
  } else {
    !is.na(nms) & nms != ""
  }
}

has_name(c(a = 'x', 'y', c = 'z'))
```

### 19.4.1 Conditions

  * || and && operators are short-circuiting. When or sees the first TRUE,
    it returns TRUE. When && sees the first FALSE, it returns FALSE.
  * You should never use | and & in an if. They're vectorized, and apply
    to multiple values.
  * With logical vectors, you can use any() or all() to collapse them
    to a single value
  * be careful with ==. It is vectorized, so you will get multiple outputs
  * You can use identical function. It is not vectorized, and requires
    the same types. identical(0L, 0) will return FALSE.
  * You also need to be careful of floating point numbers.
    sqrt(2)^2 - 2 will give a small fractional number. So you cannot
    compare floating point numbers to integers. Instead, use
    dplyr::near() for such comparisons.
  * To compare with NA, use is.na function

```{r error=FALSE}
if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) {}
# if (NA) {}  # This returns error "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed"
```

### 19.4.2 Multiple conditions

  * You can use if/else if/else
  * or switch statement
  * or cut function which discretizes continuous variables

You can chain multiple if statements:
if (x == 1) {

} else if (x == 2) {

} else {

}

Switch statement example:
```{r}
function(x, y, op) {
  switch(op,
         plus = x + y,
         minus = x - y,
         times = x * y,
         divide = x / y,
         stop("Unknown op !!")
  )
}
```

### 19.4.3 Code style

  * 2 spaces for indentation
  * an open curly brace should never go on it's own line,
    and should be followed by a newline.
    For an if-else statement, a newline between } and else is a 
    syntax error
  * it's ok to drop the curly braces if you have a small if that can fit
    on one line

### 19.4.4 Exercises

1. What’s the difference between if and ifelse()? Carefully read the help and construct three examples that illustrate the key differences.

  * ifelse is a vectorized operation while if is scalar.
    ifelse returns a vector of the same shape as the test condition.
    if returns a scalar value. Either:
    + a scalar if the test condition is a scalar
    + a scalar using only the first value of the vector test condition.
      You will also get a warning in this case.
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
ifelse(x < 3, 3, x)

if (x < 3) 3 else x
```
  * ifelse recycles it's test parameters to get a length the same
    size (ex. x < y will recycle y to get the same length as x,
    if there are less elements in y than x).
    if returns a scalar value, processing only the first element of the
    each logical side of the test vector
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(4, 3)
ifelse(x < y, TRUE, FALSE)
if (x < y) TRUE else FALSE
```

  * ifelse produces NA if there are any missing values in the test.
    if produces an error if there are any missing values in the test.
```{r}
x <- c(NA, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(4, 3)
ifelse(x < y, TRUE, FALSE)
# if (x < y) TRUE else FALSE
# Returns error:
# missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
```

  * When there is no else to the if statement, and the condition
    does not match, if returns NULL
  * ifelse always requires both yes/no conditions as parameters

2. Write a greeting function that says “good morning”, “good afternoon”, or “good evening”, depending on the time of day. (Hint: use a time argument that defaults to lubridate::now(). That will make it easier to test your function.)
```{r}
greeting <- function(time) {
  current_hour <- lubridate::hour(time)
  dplyr::case_when(
    current_hour < 12 ~ "good morning",
    current_hour < 16 ~ "good afternoon",
    TRUE              ~ "good evening"
  )
}

greeting(lubridate::now())
greeting(lubridate::ymd_hms("2021-02-01 12:00:00"))
greeting(lubridate::ymd_hms("2021-02-01 16:00:00"))
```

3. Implement a fizzbuzz function. It takes a single number as input. If the number is divisible by three, it returns “fizz”. If it’s divisible by five it returns “buzz”. If it’s divisible by three and five, it returns “fizzbuzz”. Otherwise, it returns the number. Make sure you first write working code before you create the function.

  * You cannot use && here. If you do, you will always 
    get "fizzbuzz". & works as expected here.
    Why? This is because the && operator only works on the
    first element of the vector. It is thus not useful for
    vectorized operations. 

```{r}
fizzbuzz <- function(x) {
  dplyr::case_when(
    (x %% 3 == 0) & (x %% 5 == 0) ~ "fizzbuzz", # Don't use &&,
                                                # use &
    (x %% 3 == 0) ~ "fizz",
    (x %% 5 == 0) ~ "buzz",
    TRUE ~ as.character(x)
  )
}

fizzbuzz(c(15, 3, 5, 1))
```

4. How could you use cut() to simplify this set of nested if-else statements?

  * cut is vectorized. It's very useful with labels when you have
    many values to process.
  * cut defaults to a closed interval on the right (open on left).
    Change this with right = FALSE. This gives an open interval
    on left, closed on right. This helps when you want to compare
    with < instead of with <=
  
```{r}
test <- function(temp) {
  if (temp <= 0) {
    "freezing"
  } else if (temp <= 10) {
    "cold"
  } else if (temp <= 20) {
    "cool"
  } else if (temp <= 30) {
    "warm"
  } else {
    "hot"
  }
}

test(-5)
test(5)
test(15)
test(25)
test(35)

test2 <- function(temp) {
  cut(temp, 
      breaks = c(-Inf, 0, 10, 20, 30, Inf), 
      right = FALSE, # Use this if intervals must be open on right,
                     # and closed on left.
                     # By default, intervals are open on left,
                     # and closed on right (right = FALSE).
      labels = c("freezing", "cold", "cool", "warm", "hot")
  )
}
test2(c(-50, -5, 5, 15, 25, 35))

test2(-5)
test2(5)
test2(15)
test2(25)
test2(35)
test2(c(-5, 5, 15, 25, 35))
```

5. What happens if you use switch() with numeric values?

In switch(EXPR, ...), if EXPR evaluates to a numeric value, it is
coerced to an integer. This value is used to run the value'th
parameter after EXPR and return the result.

If EXPR evaluates to a string, then it is matched exactly to the
names of the elements in ... . If there is a match, the element
is evaluated and the result returned.

6. What does this switch() call do? What happens if x is “e”?

With switch, the first matching element is evaluated.

In switch, after the expression x, the rest are of the form
name = result. Where there are no results, they are fallthrough
to the next name that has a result. If there are no matches
(in this case "e" has none), if there is an unnamed element,
it is returned. If there are more than one unnamed elements,
an error is signaled. If there are no unnamed elements, NULL
is returned.

```{r}
x <- 'e'
y <- switch(x, 
  a = ,
  b = "ab",
  c = ,
  d = "cd")
y
```

## 19.5 Function arguments

Two categories of function arguments:

  * data that the function works on
  * arguments that control the function on how it processes
    the data.
    
In general data arguments should come first, and control/detail
arguments should go later and have default values.

```{r}
# Compute the confidence interval around mean using normal approx
mean_ci <- function(x, conf = 0.95) {
  se <- sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))
  alpha <- 1 - conf
  mean(x) + se * qnorm(c(alpha / 2, 1 - alpha / 2))
}

x <- runif(100)
mean_ci(x)
mean_ci(x, conf = 0.99)
```

Default values of a function should always be the ones most used.
For example, na.rm = FALSE is good as a default since you don't
usually want to silently ignore missing values.

### 19.5.1 Choosing names

Usually, you should prefer longer, more descriptive names,
so when you read your code in the future, you can understand it.
Shorter names are usually used (correctly) for these cases:

  * x, y, z: vectors.
  * w: a vector of weights.
  * df: a data frame.
  * i, j: numeric indices (typically rows and columns).
  * n: length, or number of rows.
  * p: number of columns.

In your functions, use names that R uses. ex. na.rm

### 19.5.2 Checking values

It's important to check preconditions of arguments to a function,
and use stop to signal error.
```{r}
wt_mean <- function(x, w) {
  
  # Check to make sure preconditions are correct.
  if (length(x) != length(w)) {
    stop("`x` and `w` must be same length", 
         call. = FALSE) # The call should not become part of error
                        # message. Default call. = TRUE.
  }
  sum(w * x) / sum(w)
}
```
There is a tradeoff between making your function robust and
actually writing the meat of the function.

stopifnot checks that each argument of a function is true,
and generates an error message if not.
```{r}
wt_mean <- function(x, w, na.rm = FALSE) {
  stopifnot(is.logical(na.rm), length(na.rm) == 1)
  stopifnot(length(x) == length(w))
  
  if (na.rm == TRUE) {
    miss = is.na(x) | is.na(w)
    x <- x[!miss]
    w <- w[!miss]
  }
  sum(w * x) / sum(w)
}

# wt_mean(1:6, 6:1, na.rm = "foo")
wt_mean(1:6, 6:1, na.rm = FALSE)
```

### 19.5.3 Dot-dot-dot (...)

  * Many functions in R take an arbitrary number of inputs.
    They work because the ... in the function definition matches
    any unmatched arguments to the function. You can also 
    send those ... arguments on to other functions.
  * use list(...) inside your function to see what arguments
    have been given

```{r}
sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
stringr::str_c("a", "b", "c", "d")
```
```{r}
commas <- function(...) stringr::str_c(..., collapse = ',')
commas(letters[1:10])

rule <- function(..., pad = "-") {
  title <- paste0(...)
  width <- getOption("width") - nchar(title) - 5
  cat(title, " ", 
      stringr::str_dup(pad, 
                       width %/% stringr::str_length(pad)), 
      "\n", sep = "")
}
rule("Important output")
```

### 19.5.4 Lazy evaluation

Arguments in R are evaluated lazily. That means, they're never
evaluated if they're never called.

### 19.5.5 Exercises

1. What does commas(letters, collapse = "-") do? Why?

It produces an error. Since all arguments to commas are passed
to str_c, and we're also using collapse in the call to str_c,
we're sending collapse in twice with different values.
```{r}
# commas(letters, collapse = "-")
# Gives the error:
# formal argument "collapse" matched by multiple actual arguments
```

2. It’d be nice if you could supply multiple characters to the pad argument, e.g. rule("Title", pad = "-+"). Why doesn’t this currently work? How could you fix it?
```{r}
rule("Title", pad = "-+")
```
You can do the following. You still have to take care of the case
where the length of the pad cannot evenly divide into the width.

    stringr::str_dup(pad, 
                     width %/% stringr::str_length(pad)), 
    "\n", sep = "")

3. What does the trim argument to mean() do? When might you use it?

The trim argument removes a fraction of the numbers from the ends
of the sorted vector. This allows us to remove any outliers.

4. The default value for the method argument to cor() is c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"). What does that mean? What value is used by default?

Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman are the types of correlations
we can obtain. There is no default - a value for method has
to be given.

## 19.6 Return values

When returning values, consider:

  * does returning early make your function easier to read
  * can you make your function pipeable
  
### 19.6.1 Explicit return statements

The value returned by a function is usually the last statement
executed. But, you can explicitly return a particular value
using the return(particular_value) function. This is usually
used to:

  * return early from a function, for example when not 
    all inputs are correct
  * the function is just an if statement with one smaller
    body and one larger. You can check for the smaller body
    condition and return early
    
### 19.6.2 Writing pipeable functions

To understand if your function is pipeable, you have to know your function return type. Two basic types of pipeable functions:

  * transformations:
    Modifies the object passed to it.
  * side effects:
    Function performs a side-effect on the argument 
    (plotting a graph, saving a file).
    It should also invisibly return the argument passed into it.
    This helps when we use the %T>% pipe to pass the argument
    to the next line of code.
    To return a value invisibly, use invisible(value).
```{r}
show_missings <- function(df) {
  n <- sum(is.na(df))
  cat("Missing values: ", n, "\n", sep = "")
  
  invisible(df)
}

x <- show_missings(mtcars)
x
```
    
```{r}
mtcars %>%
  show_missings() %>%
  mutate(mpg = ifelse(mpg < 20, NA, mpg)) %>%
  show_missings()
```

## 19.7 Environment

R uses the environment to find a value associated with a variable
name used in the function. ex:
```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  x + y
}
```
This would be illegal in some languages, but R find the value in
it's lexical scope, although it is not passed into the function.

```{r}
y <- 100
f(10)

y <- 1000
f(10)
```

R allows you to do things that normally would cause an error
in other languages. But this flexibility gives you the ability
to do things that you could not:
```{r}
`+` <- function(x, y) {
  if (runif(1) < 0.1) {
    sum(x, y)
  } else {
    sum(x, y) * 1.1
  }
}
table(replicate(1000, 1 + 2))
#> 
#>   3 3.3 
#> 100 900
rm(`+`)
```

You can read the Advanced R book for more info about this.
